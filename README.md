A cafe review app

What I learned so far:
Sun Aug 24 11:58 PM --- I forgot about race conditions Bruh so now im implementing how to do race conditions...

I also am learning how to fetch and post data in React with a server

Mon Aug 25th 2:40 AM --- MY PERFORMANCE IS SO BAD WHAT THE BAKA!!!

Tues Aug 26th 2:11 AM School started im so happy and sad...
Anyways I am adding JWT to authenticate the users and will probably start
by making a database and then making a prisma models for users
WISH ME LUCK!!!!

Tues Aug 26th 7:08 PM Messed up I chose JWT when I didn't need it
and session data would've suffice... wasted hours omg
