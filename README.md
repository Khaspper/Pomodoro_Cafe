## My Development Journey

Dear Diary...

Sun Aug 24 11:58 PM --- I forgot about race conditions Bruh so now im implementing how to do stop race conditions...

I also am learning how to fetch and post data in React with a server

Mon Aug 25th 2:40 AM --- MY PERFORMANCE IS SO BAD WHAT THE BAKA!!!

Tues Aug 26th 2:11 AM School started im so happy and sad...
Anyways I am adding JWT to authenticate the users and will probably start
by making a database and then making a prisma models for users
WISH ME LUCK!!!!

Tues Aug 26th 7:08 PM Messed up I chose JWT when I didn't need it
and session data would've suffice... wasted hours omg

Wed Aug 27th 11:03 PM I Added errors to show in the UI
BUT I FORGOT TO ADD TESTS FIRST AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Mon Sept 1st 12:45 AM I didn't realize how hard it is to authenticate a user with a separate front and
backend wow that was annoying... But I learned about protect routes

Mon Sept 1st 10:01 PM I learned more about mocking functions And how much I hate Mocking I will start writing pure functions from now on...

Wed Sept 3rd 2:18 PM OMG I FINISHED THE TESTS!!!! NOW I GET TO IMPLEMENT
GOOGLE MAPS API IM SCARED BUT EXCITED AT THE SAME TIME

Thu Sept 4th 3:25 AM FREAK google maps I don't wanna pay...
So shout out to Syntax and CJ on youtube I found
OpenFreeMaps and I found react-maplibre!!!!
I so EXCITED

Fri Sept 19th 7:10 PM Greetings... it's been a while XD I'm pretty much done with the project... I just need to polish it
sorry for not updating... I just got really lazy... but today I am going to try to get rid of all the todos as fast as I can
so I can deploy this project... but I am going to start off with learning what Logging is... I am researching about morgan
right now!

Fri Sept 19th 8:23 PM Just put dotenv client side... yeah yeah yeah i know i know

Fri Sept 19th 10:34 PM Omg I have to add rate limiting

Fri Sept 19th 11:51 PM Rate limiting... I hate you why is it so complicated
I thought it was so easy UNTIL I SAW MY TERMINAL TALKING BOUT IPv6
WHAT THE FREAK!!!! I'm on a time crunch so I will ignore this for now and will get back to this later...
Rate limit: 1
Markus: 0

Fri Sept 19th 12:45 PM I will add health check API idk I saw a youtube video talking about it so now I just wanna implement it

Tue Sep 23rd 6:58 PM Finished the project... I hate front end I hate margins I hate figma I hate padding I hate color theory I hate it all but it has taught me a lot 10 / 10 would hate again I just have to deploy this website and then I am done frfr
